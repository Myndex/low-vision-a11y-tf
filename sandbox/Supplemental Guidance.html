<td>Proximity of interaction relationships</td>
<td colspan="2">This covers proximity of labels and controls as well as proximity of on-screen keyboard to input fields - e.g. Desmos on iPad where these two things are not near each other. <br>This is a COGA overlap, but important for vision, as are focus indicators, as accomodation for impairments such as zooming can hamper these relationships.</td>

This isn&#39;t so much as fail under current requirements as it can be accepted and dismissed but requiring low vision users to accept something that a non-disabled user can choose not to seems un equal. <br/>This issue also occurs with videos that cover text when zoomed in or when controls cover text when zoomed in but the text can be scrolled.</td>

<td>Text alignment on edge of viewport</td>
<td colspan="2">When text is aligned on the left edge it can make it difficult to read the first characters and thus the first word of text. A small amount of padding on the edges of text that adjoins the edge of the screen can assist some users.

<td>Scaling for resize of text for large type elements</td>
<td colspan="2">Large headings may already be 200% the body size of text. Responsive design reduces amount of content on screen taking away context and surrounding context.
